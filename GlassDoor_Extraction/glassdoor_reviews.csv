Worst company to work.

Dislikes
Applied through internshala, received a message on internshala to submit a assignment.
After submitting the assignment if you are lucky then after 2-3 months you will get a reply. Then there is a guy who claims himself as cto of the company without any technical knowledge who will take your interview just for name sake in Skype.
After interview, you will receive a offer letter ASAP, then they will create a pressure to accept the offer letter within one day and the moment you will reply to their offer letter, they will call you in Skype and ask you to work from that moment only even if your joining date is after few days. (suppose your joining date is after two - three days they will not consider this thing they will ask you to work from the moment you accept the offer letter). In offer letter it will be written that you will get training and all and you will receive 10000 rs per month till next 6 months.
That's the story till joining.
Now after joining.
Once you join, they will not give you training. They will directly give you a big project to work on and expect to complete the tasks that they will give you without any help or any guidance. (if you complain about this then they will tell you that this is how we give training).
Then after 1-2 weeks, they will change your project and give you a client project to work on, where there is no management, you will have to handle the client and talk to the client directly no support from anyone.
Now when you work on client project the client will have a deadline and you will have to complete the tasks within the deadline or if any chance you fail to do so, the cto, founder or coo will scold you.
* the company uses Skype as professional communication tool rather than Microsoft teams.
* the company will make you work from morning 10 am to night 9 pm (almost).
* No holidays on Saturdays.
* No job security because one of my friend lost the job without any reason when his 6 months was going to complete.
* they make fools to their client even the founder, cto or coo don't knows how to talk properly to their clients.
* only 2 developers will work on a project.
* sick minded people in the company because the company is being run by a group of family members there are 3 main members else are hr and all. (means everyone who is in a good designation in the company are the family members of the founder).
* No work life balance always felt pressurized.
* they will make you work like a full time employee of software developer, but pay you 10k in name of training period of 6 months.
I would really like to meet all the 3 people of the company.

**** Most of the positive reviews are given by the employees are because the coo/cto told them to do so ****
