Worst company to work.

Dislikes
Applied through internshala, received a message on internshala to submit a assignment.
After submitting the assignment if you are lucky then after 2-3 months you will get a reply. Then there is a guy who claims himself as cto of the company without any technical knowledge who will take your interview just for name sake in Skype.
After interview, you will receive a offer letter ASAP, then they will create a pressure to accept the offer letter within one day and the moment you will reply to their offer letter, they will call you in Skype and ask you to work from that moment only even if your joining date is after few days. (suppose your joining date is after two - three days they will not consider this thing they will ask you to work from the moment you accept the offer letter). In offer letter it will be written that you will get training and all and you will receive 10000 rs per month till next 6 months.
That's the story till joining.
Now after joining.
Once you join, they will not give you training. They will directly give you a big project to work on and expect to complete the tasks that they will give you without any help or any guidance. (if you complain about this then they will tell you that this is how we give training).
Then after 1-2 weeks, they will change your project and give you a client project to work on, where there is no management, you will have to handle the client and talk to the client directly no support from anyone.
Now when you work on client project the client will have a deadline and you will have to complete the tasks within the deadline or if any chance you fail to do so, the cto, founder or coo will scold you.
* the company uses Skype as professional communication tool rather than Microsoft teams.
* the company will make you work from morning 10 am to night 9 pm (almost).
* No holidays on Saturdays.
* No job security because one of my friend lost the job without any reason when his 6 months was going to complete.
* they make fools to their client even the founder, cto or coo don't knows how to talk properly to their clients.
* only 2 developers will work on a project.
* sick minded people in the company because the company is being run by a group of family members there are 3 main members else are hr and all. (means everyone who is in a good designation in the company are the family members of the founder).
* No work life balance always felt pressurized.
* they will make you work like a full time employee of software developer, but pay you 10k in name of training period of 6 months.
I would really like to meet all the 3 people of the company.
**** This company is a total scam, do not join. ****
**** Most of the positive reviews are given by the employees are because the coo/cto told them to do so ****

Is it a world best company to work? Let's find it.,1.0,Data Science Intern,New Delhi,"Former Intern, less than 1 year","If you are fresher and want to mention some internships on your resume then you can work here. Here, you're working on a real-world project. If you got your internship here don't settle, start searching for other companies and move on as early as possible. Salary is on time. The interview is soo easy that you can pass it in your sleep.","This company has so many cons if I write all of them then the word limit get exceeds, so try to write as much as possible.

1. This company has no full-time working employees. It runs on the shoulders of the Intern.
2. There is no mentor to help with your assigned project. There is one person who assigns you a project and told you to do as early as possible because they take projects from freelancing platform which have a deadline. Here one intern helps another and if other interns also don't know anything about the assigned project then god bless you.
3. The stipend given by them is much lower than the project you are doing here as an intern. Their max stipend is 5000 per month. 
4. They say they give you a full-time role but in the last Tata-Bye-Bye. Because they know another intern is ready to work on that much stipend. If they give (I am 100% sure they won't) please-please don't take it.
5. They are like Harshad Mehta of the IT industry. They got a loophole in the IT system to exploit and earn as much money can via the interns.
6. If the Intern won't able to do a project then they simply transfer to another intern and if anyone can't do it then they return the project to the client. Then you wait for another project for maybe a month or two.
7. No off on Saturday.
8. Intern work like full-time employees from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M.
9. They hold your internship if you don't perform and they will not teach you anything. You have to learn from yourself and complete your project.
10. Still want to work here then ""BEST WISHES"" from all the former Interns.",07-07-21
